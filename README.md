Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
COmputer scientist work with research in varying fields of data science, AI, machne learning, among many others. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
We have to think critically and adhere to best practices when resolving issues. I like to work in an iterative fashion and deal with one part of the pronblem at a time, then build on it as I move forward.
